I recently had the chance to test out one of their hottest products, a dual USB-C Docking Station that allows me to connect both my wide-screen monitors to my MacBook with Dual 4K@60Hz display connectivity. It also supports up to 96W laptop charging, which is awesome. If you are in a situation like me and want to upgrade your equipment, check out this and their other products!
